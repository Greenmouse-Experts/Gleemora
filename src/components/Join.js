            <p>Women with reproductive health challenges report changing pads or tampons as often as every 45 â€“ 60 minutes. This is an expensive ordeal for women in Africa.</p>
            <p>According to a 2023 BBC research, women on the minimum wage in Africa have to spend one in every seven dollars they earn on sanitary pads. The local cost of the cheapest sanitary pads was beyond the reach of many women.</p>
            <p className='p'>Gleemora is committed to supporting women across Africa who are struggling with "period poverty." We will donate a portion of our profit to this initiative.
